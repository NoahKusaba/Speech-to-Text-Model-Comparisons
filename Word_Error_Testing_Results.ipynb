So, this was a late change to the plan. There were several rallies that he was due to attend yesterday. They all have to be carried out by other people in place of him. And then last night, we got the announcement that he won\\'t be attending in Parson, this Flagship event today which is due to begin in about an hour and a half\\'s time. And that is the inauguration of turkeys. First nuclear, power plant, and instead of attending in person, I\\'m presiding over that, you\\'ll be attending by video-link. I were told that the Russian leader Vladimir Putin will be doing the same. This was a Russian bills plant, but of course, What is aces is critically? It\\'s pretty important.

Alliance is called come out of college. Derulo interesting that he was one of the first people to wish the president of speedy recovery. Iowa news broke that he was on, well, with the pose are putting cholesterolu ahead, it is a fight for every single vote. Now, in the fact, the president erdogan has to miss important campaign, appearances in person gives us some indication that he is quite on, well, as it became clear on Tuesday night. There was a problem. He was in the middle of a live TV interview. The camera was not focus on the president who was focused on the interviewer who was asking a question. But we could hear some muffled noises. We could hear a kind of a gas and then we heard somebody say off, oh my goodness. And then there was a recording the transmission. 20 minutes. So definitely there was a problem, but the official line from a turkey\\'s president\\'s spokesman is that this is a stomach bug that we don\\'t yet have information about when he\\'ll be appearing again in public to resume his hectic, campaign schedule.

I, we were in on Corral, on board, a high-speed train when she was supposed to inaugurate. We were all in our seats. And we were told at the very last minute, I thought he would not be attending. So, this was a late change to the plan. There were several rallies that he was due to attend yesterday. They all have to be carried out by other people in place of him. And then last night, we got the announcement that he won\\'t be attending in Parson, this Flagship event today which is due to begin in about an hour and a half\\'s time. And that is the inauguration of turkeys. First nuclear, power plant, and instead of attending in person, I\\'m presiding over that, you\\'ll be attending by video-link. I were told that the Russian leader Vladimir Putin will be doing the same. This was a Russian bills plant, but of course, What is aces is critically? It\\'s pretty important. In terms of timing, because we have elections here in just about two and a half weeks, get a little bit more about that because it is a crucial type of present to dwell on his face, many problems over the past year. Or so, not least the devastating earthquake and the government responds to Waze I think, looking back over his, more than 20 years in power, he is vulnerable. Now, as he never has been before, and many of the opinion polls in the last few weeks have given a slightly to his main Challenger. I, he\\'s a second or kinda Day from a combined opposition. Alliance is called come out of college. Derulo interesting that he was one of the first people to wish the president of speedy recovery. Iowa news broke that he was on, well, with the pose are putting cholesterolu ahead, it is a fight for every single vote. Now, in the fact, the president erdogan has to miss important campaign, appearances in person gives us some indication that he is quite on, well, as it became clear on Tuesday night. There was a problem. He was in the middle of a live TV interview. The camera was not focus on the president who was focused on the interviewer who was asking a question. But we could hear some muffled noises. We could hear a kind of a gas and then we heard somebody say off, oh my goodness. And then there was a recording the transmission. 20 minutes. So definitely there was a problem, but the official line from a turkey\\'s president\\'s spokesman is that this is a stomach bug that we don\\'t yet have information about when he\\'ll be appearing again in public to resume his hectic, campaign schedule.

The program went off air for 20 minutes, after which Erdogan apologized and said he had an upset stomach. Our senior correspondent, Orla Guerrarin, has more from Istanbul. While his officials are certainly trying to play it down. The president himself tweeted yesterday morning he had been advised by his doctors to take a day's rest. So all of yesterday's events were canceled. Now, we were actually due to be traveling with the president yesterday ourselves. We were in Ankara on board a high speed train, which he was supposed to inaugurate. We were all in our seats, and we were told at the very last minute that he would not be attending. So this was a late change to the plan. There were several rallies that he was due to attend yesterday. They all had to be carried out by other people in place of him. And then last night, we got the announcement that he won't be attending in person this flagship event today, which is due to begin in about an hour and a half's time, and that is the inauguration of Turkey's first nuclear power plant. Instead of attending in person and presiding over that, he'll be attending by video link. We're told that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin will be doing the same. This was a Russian built plant. But of course, all of this is critically important in terms of timing because we have elections here in just about two and a half weeks. Yeah, tell us a bit more about that, because it is a crucial type of president who's faced many problems over the past year or so, not least a devastating earthquake and the government's response to it. I think, looking back over his more than 20 years in power, he is vulnerable now as he never has been before. And many of the opinion polls in the last few weeks have given a slight lead to his main challenger. He's a secular candidate from a combined opposition alliance who's called Kamal Kilich Jerolo interestingly. He was one of the first people to wish the president a speedy recovery when news broke that he was on well, but the polls are putting Kilichjarolo ahead. It is a fight for every single vote now, and the fact that President Erdogan has to miss important campaign appearances in person gives us some indication that he is quite unwell. It became clear on Tuesday night there was a problem. He was in the middle of a live TV interview. The camera was not focused on the president. It was focused on the interviewer who was asking a question. But we could hear some waffled noises. We could hear a kind of a gasp, and then we heard somebody say off camera, oh, my goodness.
